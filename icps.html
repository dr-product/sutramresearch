      <h1>Indian Constitutional Provisions for Surveys</h1>
      <p>
        Article 19 of the Indian Constitution says "Everyone has the right to
        freedom of opinion and expression, this right includes freedom to hold
        opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
        information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers".
        Further, the Supreme Court observed that "Freedom of speech and
        expression includes right to impart and receive information which
        includes freedom to hold opinions".
      </p>

        NexaStats is a law-abiding Indian entity incorporated as a Trust.
        It has engaged in Market Research activities since its inception, within
        the electoral and brand domain, inviting people's opinion on
        socio¬economic issues with no allegiance to any political outfit or
        organization. Eliciting people's opinion within an ethical framework, on
        a voluntary basis, towards empowering the citizenry is well within the
        purview of the constitution and plays a significant role in the
        democratic machinery.

        Any obstruction to the field activities carried out by NexaStats
        through its nominated personnel by any individual, entity or association
        will be seen as an obstruction to the democratic right provided by the
        Indian Constitution, inviting legal proceedings.
